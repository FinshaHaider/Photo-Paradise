It seems like the images are not displaying on the webpage. This issue could be related to the way the media files are being served in Django.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and possibly solve the issue:

1. **Check MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT settings**:
    - Ensure that `MEDIA_URL` is correctly set in your Django settings file (`settings.py`). It should be the URL from which media files are served.
    - `MEDIA_ROOT` should point to the directory where you are storing the media files on your server.

2. **Verify the image path**:
    - Print out the image URL (`{{n.image.url}}`) inside the loop to see the complete URL being generated. This will help you verify if the path is correct and accessible.
  
3. **Configure URLs for media files**:
    - Make sure that you have configured URLs for serving media files in your project's `urls.py`.
    - In your development `urls.py`, you can add a URL pattern to serve media files using Django's `static()` function.

4. **Check file permissions**:
    - Ensure that the media files have the correct permissions set so that the web server can access and serve them.

5. **Run collectstatic command**:
    - If you are in a production environment, make sure to run the `collectstatic` command to gather all static files including media files in a single directory.

6. **Debugging in the browser**:
    - Open your browser's developer tools (usually F12 key) and check the network tab to see if there are any errors related to loading the image files.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue of images not showing up on your website.
